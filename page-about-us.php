        <h4>Nackademin GYM exists to give everyone who wants the opportunity to find their own desire for movement. We know that if training is going to work, it has to be fun. And we know that the joy of movement is personal. Therefore, our training is in many different ways. But regardless of what you choose, our training is an experience for both the body and the senses. We are more in the experience business than in the health business.
        <br></br>

Nackademin - GYM sees training as a natural part of life. All people need movement to feel good. Therefore, our training is a free zone from performance requirements and skewed ideals. With us, you get to be exactly who you are.
<br></br>
We inspire you to get started - and make you feel good so you never want to stop. Because if you enjoy it, you will continue to train. You become safer, stronger and dare to challenge your limits. You grow as a person and we as a movement. Over the years, hundreds of thousands of people have become part of us.
<br></br>
Nackademin - GYM is a common denominator for people of all ages, lifestyles and interests. Together, we are a proud non-profit association that engages and changes. We have done that ever since
